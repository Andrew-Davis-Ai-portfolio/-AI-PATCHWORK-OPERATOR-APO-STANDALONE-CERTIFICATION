🔒 AI PATCHWORK OPERATOR (APO) — STANDALONE CERTIFICATION

Mission:
Train and verify humans who can ship real systems using AI under ambiguity, pressure, and responsibility — without traditional coding paths.

This certification exists because:

Modern work rewards operators, not typists.

⸻

🧠 CORE PHILOSOPHY (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
	1.	AI is a collaborator, not authority
	2.	Humans own outcomes, AI executes instructions
	3.	Failure is information, not punishment
	4.	Explanations matter as much as outputs
	5.	Completion ≠ readiness — verification does

No motivation speeches.
No shortcuts.
No “look at me” demos.

⸻

🧪 ASSESSMENT MODEL (REAL-WORLD ONLY)
	•	✅ Client-simulated scenarios
	•	✅ Vague / incomplete requirements
	•	✅ Constraint changes mid-task
	•	✅ Silent failure states
	•	✅ Human explanation required at each level

❌ No multiple-choice
❌ No memorization
❌ No “AI wrote it” defense

⸻

🧱 CERTIFICATION STRUCTURE (LOCKED)

⚙️ Level Gate Rule
	•	Levels must be passed in order
	•	Failure pauses progress
	•	Reflection is required before reattempt
	•	No unlimited retries

⸻

🪜 LEVEL BREAKDOWN (v1 DEFINITIVE)

🥉 LEVEL 1 — Structured Prompting Operator

Reality Simulated: Junior task tickets

Test:
	•	Clear task
	•	Single objective
	•	Defined output

Must Demonstrate:
	•	Precise prompting
	•	Constraint use
	•	Verification of AI output
	•	Minimal correction loops

✅ Pass = usable output without rewrites
❌ Fail = vague prompts, blind trust, no verification

⸻

🥈 LEVEL 2 — Multi-File Systems Reasoning

Reality Simulated: Feature delivery

Test:
	•	HTML / CSS / JS or equivalent components
	•	Files must correctly interact

Must Demonstrate:
	•	Dependency awareness
	•	File separation logic
	•	Execution order understanding
	•	AI delegation across components

✅ Pass = system runs as intended
❌ Fail = monolithic prompting, broken flow, guesswork

⸻

🥇 LEVEL 3 — Debug Under Constraint

Reality Simulated: Live production issue

Test:
	•	Broken system
	•	No hint where bug is
	•	Time constraint applied

Must Demonstrate:
	•	Analytical debugging
	•	Controlled prompting
	•	Hypothesis testing
	•	Minimal disturbance fixes

✅ Pass = issue resolved & explained
❌ Fail = rewrite-everything instincts, panic loops

⸻

🧨 LEVEL 4 — Requirement Drift

Reality Simulated: Client change orders

Test:
	•	Spec changes mid-build
	•	Conflicting constraints
	•	Performance or security concerns introduced

Must Demonstrate:
	•	Prompt adaptation
	•	Impact analysis
	•	Tradeoff explanation
	•	Change isolation

✅ Pass = system adapts without collapse
❌ Fail = brittle design, emotional responses, shortcuts

⸻

🏴‍☠️ LEVEL 5 — Contract Simulation (NO MERCY)

Reality Simulated: Senior remote operator

Test:
	•	Incomplete spec
	•	Ambiguous goals
	•	Ethical & governance constraints
	•	No hand-holding

Must Demonstrate:
	•	Requirement interrogation
	•	AI orchestration
	•	Risk identification
	•	Human accountability
	•	Clear verbal explanation

✅ Pass = ship + justify
❌ Fail = silence, blame-shifting, overconfidence

⸻

🏅 CERTIFICATION CRITERIA

To be certified AI Patchwork Operator:

✅ All 5 levels passed
✅ Ethics Coach passed (spoken)

📜 WHAT THIS CERT MEANS (PUBLIC-FACING)

“This person can deliver under ambiguity using AI, explain their decisions, recover from failure, and take responsibility for outcomes.”

That’s it.
Nothing inflated. Nothing false.
